# Portfolio
## Short-Term Mine Planner | Mining & Metallurgical Engineer | Data & Digital Mining
I am a Mining and Metallurgical Engineer currently working as a Short-Term Mine Planner in an open-pit gold operation. My professional background also includes experience as an Operational Excellence Engineer, where I specialized in data analytics, digitalization, and performance monitoring for mining and processing operations.
My profile combines operational planning, data-driven analysis, and digital tool development, with a strong focus on creating solutions that are technically sound, operationally realistic, and scalable.
This repository serves as a central portfolio showcasing projects where mining engineering, analytics, and digital transformation converge.

## Professional Profile 
I currently support short-term planning activities, including weekly and monthly mine planning, while leveraging a strong background in operational data analysis developed during my time in Operational Excellence roles.
Previously, I worked closely with production, processing, and management teams to:
* Design and deploy data pipelines for operational KPIs
* Develop dashboards and analytics for executive and operational decision-making
* Digitalize field data capture in low-connectivity, harsh mining environments
* Integrate data from SCADA systems, SAP, SQL databases, and manual sources
* Improve traceability of consumables and metallurgical variables
This dual exposure allows me to understand both how plans are built and how operations actually behave, enabling more realistic planning and better analytical models.

## Continuous Learning & Applied Analytics
In parallel with my operational role, I actively work on machine learning and AI-based projects as part of my continuous professional development.
These initiatives focus on:
* Applying supervised and unsupervised ML models to operational datasets
* Enhancing current workflows through automation, prediction, and anomaly detection
* Exploring how AI can support planning, optimization, and operational excellence
My experience working directly with real mining data has significantly improved how I design, validate, and interpret analytical models—bridging the gap between theoretical approaches and operational constraints.
